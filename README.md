## What the template does

This is a **bilingual Astro starter for cinematic editorial websites**: book launches, author portfolios, creative studios, and narrative projects. It generates a fast static site with no CMS, database, or runtime API required.

The template gives you the page structure and visual system; you replace the example data, artwork, links, and legal copy with your own project.

This project is based on Astro's [Space theme](https://astro.build/themes/details/space/).

**Keywords:** Astro template · bilingual website · editorial design · book website · portfolio starter · Three.js · WebGL · static site · i18n · responsive landing page

### What visitors see

The homepage is designed as an immersive entry point:

1. A full-screen dark space scene provides the visual background.
2. A large particle-based title appears over the scene and reacts to pointer movement.
3. A floating cover or project image acts as the primary entry point.
4. The lower action row provides localized purchase, legal, and attribution links.
5. The language switcher lets visitors move between `/es/` and `/en/` without losing context.

The detail route then turns the same visual language into a readable editorial page with a cover, title, description, calls to action, metadata, and responsive layout. On reduced-motion or unsupported-WebGL devices, semantic text and static fallbacks remain available.

### Included capabilities

- localized `/es/` and `/en/` routes;
- static Astro generation with canonical and alternate-language metadata;
- book or project landing pages with responsive layouts;
- immersive WebGL background and particle-title effects;
- localized legal, cookie, and third-party attribution pages;
- accessible navigation, focus states, reduced-motion support, and responsive fallbacks.

## See it in action

The production site [`thetempuscode.com`](https://thetempuscode.com) is the live demo of the experience this template is designed to produce. The repository keeps generic example data so you can replace the branding, copy, and artwork with your own project.
